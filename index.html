        <p>Why did I choose CIS (Computer Information Systems) as my major? Well for a couple actually, the reason you're wondering about (&ldquo;Why not Computer Science?&rdquo;), was due to one factor alone. Computer Science and Computer Information Systems consist of nearly <span>identical</span> required courses. Moreover the very few classes that CS requires, are available as electives in CIS. However, the key difference is CS requires a shit ton more of math. Since i find math to be <a href="javascript:gaySeal();">annoying shit</a>, it wouldn't make since to not take choose the option to take the exact same courses, but not have to take as much math. Being that math is <a href="javascript:gaySeal();">well.....</a></p>

        <h2 class="Info">Background Information</h2>

        <section id="backInfo">
          <p class="personal">Well let's see here.... As far as background information is concerned unfortunately there is a lot more negative than positive. Basically throughout my life the actions of many people have somewhat made me who I am. Apart from my immediate family (meaning ONLY siblings and mother) I for the most part dislike everyone. Okay that's a little unfair to say, a better way of putting it is, I do not believe there exists such a thing as a good person, anywhere in the world, or at any point in time, past, present, or future. I believe they are bad people who choose to good things, sure some people might do good things their whole life, but at ones core everyone is a bad person. Again apart from immediate family, I have a extreme lack, if not complete lack of sympathy and empathy for everyone. However I love animals, all animals, they can always make me happy. That is one of the extremely few <span>positive</span> aspects of my character, per-se, that carry me from day to day, the rest is just sadistic hateful spite, rage, and emptiness that keep me going.</p>

          <p class="education1"> On the flip side of the &ldquo;Background Information&rdquo; coin I guess there would be the background of my chosen field of study, CS. Really it's pretty short and simple, I always loved computers and the endless possibilities they could and continue to achieve. I love not only the stuff you see on-screen, I am obsessed with the tangible portion of it. Picking out each component of hardware, assembling it piece by piece is just blissful to me. However, back to the reason I chose the field of CS, (yes CS is the field I chose, CIS is a discipline within CS) to be honest is somewhat adolescent in its nature. Nonetheless it is the reason I am studying it today. In short, way back when, I got this virus, one of the worse ones I have ever seen, I'll spare you the details, but it ended up actually basically bricking (look it up if you don't know what that means) my HDD. I lost around four years of pictures, vids, data, etc. I didn't even attempt to fix it after that, I didn't even touch a computer for almost six months I was so depressed. I eventually got back on the horse and got everything up and running again and was good for another couple years.... Then I got another virus, this was also an extremely brutal one, it didn't so much effect the data on my HDD, as it effected the actual physical HDD itself, or at least it resulted in the actual hardware malfunctioning. The HDD wasn't ruined I could connect it as an external drive and it would recognize it was there, but any attempt to open, view, modify, do anything to the contents and it would freeze, only being able to be resolved by actually unplugging it. So I decided, fuck this, I don't care I'm not losing another HDD, so I started looking into HDD Data Recovery. There was (may still be) only one local business that does HDD Data Recovery, after they looked at my HDD they gave me an estimate of around $11,000 to get the data off it. Yeah... that's pretty much what I thought. So I looked online and found a place that guaranteed the lowest price, it sounded promising. I shipped my HDD to them and after a bit they sent it back with an estimate attached, and a pre-paid shipping label if I decided to have them recover the data. Their estimate was right around $6,000. Yes, that is how much Data Recovery cost, and by Data Recovery I hope you're not naive to infer that Data Recovery is,</p>
          <span class="morons">&ldquo;OH NO! I deleted a really important file, AND emptied my Recycle Bin, ANNDDD <span class="moreMorons">*nervous flop sweat*</span> then I defragged my HDD, it's gone forever.&rdquo;</span>
          <p class="education2">...if that is you, then you don't deserve to step foot in the building of Computing and Engineering Sciences. Anyways, I got interested in the subject of Data Recovery, mainly due its cost, I figured the employees must make a pretty damn good salary. Now here's the thing, probably 60%-70% of HDD that actually do seem like they need Data Recovery can actually be recovered using software, if it's worse you can actually replace the PCB on HDDs which solve a lot of errors that would seem unfixable. Data Recovery is ONLY needed when the HDD has to be physically opened. I came to find out the cost comes from the fact that when, in the slim chance, Data Recovery is the only option it requires a Level 3 Lab, that is sterile and particle free, full body suits are worn, and it takes days of meticulous labor to fix. A single particle of dust hitting the read/write head is like a car slamming head-on into a tree. Unfortunately Data Recovery isn't really one of the things you can go to school for, which I found a little hard to believe, but it still seems to be true. From There the story really wraps up quick. I realized that Data Recovery not really being an easy to enter career, I kind of shifted my viewpoint, not as you may think either. I figured if someone could write some code that could do something to my HDD that would result in a $6,000 min fix, I wanted to learn to do it to. As is with many things in life, in order to have the knowledge to destroy, one must have the knowledge to create. Consequently, I am here today, and as my education proceeds it will always stem from a root of hatred and malevolence.

              <li><span>Web-Design specifically is somewhat of a side goal, granted I realize how fundamental understanding html is, but I still find it annoying as hell.</span></li>
              <li><span>Graphic Design itself I actually like a lot but, when its context correlates to a career, I've been told over and over that generally what you design is boring crap that the customer wants. As opposed to designs that one makes your only limitation is your imagination.</span></li>
              <li><span>I love programming and learning programming languages.</span></li>
              <li><span>I have no interest in making some new discovery or developing a ground-breaking theory in the world of CS.</span></li>
              <li><span>To be honest the main reason I had for wanting to learn CS, many many many years ago, was so I could learn to make viruses, rootkits, unrecoverable data scripts, hacking, etc... I'm not gonna lie and say that goal has subsided much.</span></li>
              <li><span>As far a career is concerned I really don't care, as long I as get to program, it doesn't matter to me what the context is.</span></li>
